## Text Editors & Terminals

----

### What is a text editor?
A text editor is a program that can be used in several different ways. In my situation, it is what I am using to develpe **this web page**!. How can you access a text edditor? Text edditors are very easy to get! You can simply download and install what ever editor you perfer to your computer or use one that is local to a website like GitHub.  Selecting a text editor can be very improtant because it is the main tool that you will use in development! 

### What should you look for in a text editor?
 While there are several different types of text edditors to use, it is vital to look into your options. When considering a text editor you will have to weigh out differnt factors like:

 1. Cost: Some edditors are completley free to use while others may have trial periods or a flat fee to purchase the software.
 2. Usability: While some are universal, not all text edditors unfortunatly work on all computers. There are a varience of options for each operating system.
 3. Work preferences: If you are starting to develope for your place of work, they may all use a specific text edditor. This is not crutial but can help in the process of working together!
 4. Personal Preference: This is where your opinion comes in. What text edditor best suits what you are looking for? Is it presentabale and easy to manuover? It is also key to look for edditors that have code completion & syntax highlighting to be more efficeint.

- Deffinitions: 
   - Syntax Highlighting: This feature displays text and code that you have written in different colours and fonts according to the code used, markdown effect, etc. It also can make your text easier to read when it comes to finding errors.
   - Code Completion: Code completion is constantly working while you are entering code. The code completion feature will diplay suggestions like end brackets, full code for inserting photos & hyper links, etc. This is based on what you originally begin to type in your code edditor. This can be benifical when working on large projects with lots of open and closing code!
   - IDE: (Integrated Development Environment) An IDE is a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

A terminal is the actual interface to your computer that you can type and execute text based commands. The terminal is used to execute commands that allow you to do a certain task like: display computer content, locate and create file pathways, create networks, and so much more! The commands that you use while working in a terminal can very based on the Terminal used, but all use common lauges from the tech community.

If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .



The command line interface (CLI), or the language that you type into Terminal to interact with your Mac, is called bash. Everything we discuss below is a bash command. Before you start using Terminal, you customize it to your own personal preference.

Stick Notes. Shell Scripting is the language of the linux terminal. Shell scripts are sometimes referred to as “shebang” which is derived from the “#!” notation. Shell scripts are executed by interpreters present in the linux kernel.
