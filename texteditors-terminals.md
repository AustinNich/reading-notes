## Text Editors & Terminals

### What is a text editor?
A text editor is a program that can be used in several different ways. In my situation, it is what I am using to develpe **this web page**!. How can you access a text edditor? Text edditors are very easy to get! You can simply download and install what ever editor you perfer to your computer or use one that is local to a website like GitHub.  Selecting a text editor can be very improtant because it is the main tool that you will use in development! 

### What should you look for in a text editor?
 While there are several different types of text edditors to use, it is vital to look into your options. When considering a text editor you will have to weigh out differnt factors like:

 1. Cost: Some edditors are completley free to use while others may have trial periods or a flat fee to purchase the software.
 2. Usability: While some are universal, not all text edditors unfortunatly work on all computers. There are a varience of options for each operating system.
 3. Work preferences: If you are starting to develope for your place of work, they may all use a specific text edditor. This is not crutial but can help in the process of working together!
 4. Personal Preference: This is where your opinion comes in. What text edditor best suits what you are looking for? Is it presentabale and easy to manuover? It is also key to look for edditors that have code completion & syntax highlighting to be more efficeint.

- Deffinitions: 
   - Syntax Highlighting: This feature displays text and code that you have written in different colours and fonts according to the code used, markdown effect, etc. It also can make your text easier to read when it comes to finding errors.
   - Code Completion: Code completion is constantly working while you are entering code. The code completion feature will diplay suggestions like end brackets, full code for inserting photos & hyper links, etc. This is based on what you originally begin to type in your code edditor. This can be benifical when working on large projects with lots of open and closing code!
   - IDE: (Integrated Development Environment) An IDE is a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
