Markdown is one of the basic code laungages that a experinced or **beginner** coder can use to devolepe websites, documents, notes, etc! While markdown may sound complex, and it is in many ways, the key is that it is just a langauge accumulated of symbols that vary in different arragments. 

###### Markdown examples:

Code | Effect
------------ | -------------
`# Header 1`| Content from cell 2
`## Header 2`| Content in the second column
