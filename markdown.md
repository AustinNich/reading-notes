### Markdown and how it is used

Markdown is one of the basic code laungages that a experinced or ***beginner*** coder can use to devolepe websites, documents, notes, etc! While markdown may sound complex, and it is in many ways, the key is that it is just a langauge accumulated of symbols that vary in different arragments. Once you know a little more about what symbols to use and where to use them, you will be able to format and develope what ever you would like and make it look well put together!
