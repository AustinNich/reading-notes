Markdown is one of the basic code languages that an experienced or ***beginner*** coder can use to develop websites, documents, notes, etc! While markdown may sound complex, and it is in many ways, the key is that it is just a language accumulated of symbols that vary in different arrangements. Once you know a little more about what symbols to use and where to use them, you will be able to format and develop what ever you would like and make it look well put together! 

### Getting Started

First off, lets determine what it is that you are wanting to code! Markdown is very wide spread so you have a few options, but I will focus on this web site for example! Once that is sorted out you will need to create a new file on your computer for the project, as well as open the file in a code editor! If you are interested in making a web page through GitHub pages as well, here is a [_link_](https://pages.github.com/) that will help you get your first repository set up and cloned to your computer so you can start coding.  If you are not for sure what editor to use, there are tons that you can look into online to see what fits you best!

###### Markdown examples:

`###### Smallest Header`| displays your text as a header in the smallest heading size
`_Italics_`| _Markdown_
