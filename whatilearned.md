## What I Learned

In the process of making this page I strived to make it as educational as possible. Doing this, I was also able to learn a lot as well. Specific to my background, I dont really have much experience in external text editors or markdown. While I have worked in terminal, I now have a better understanding of how to set up text with markdown in visual editors like VIM/Vi IMproved. 

On top of this, I have been able to learn more about developing a website and how to publish my changes. This has been a great experience that I would definitely recommend to beginners. What I liked the most about this all, was actually being able to see all my changes to the code in real time. This was very beneficial to me, especially with github making each step in getting a site up easily achievable. 

Overall, I have a good bit more to learn but I am also taking a lot of good knowledge with me. If any of this was interesting to you and you want to keep learning more, get out there! Give github a try and see what you can create!
