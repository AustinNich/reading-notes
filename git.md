# Using Git in a Terminal

----

## What is Git?

Before we dive into how to use git, lets get a better understanging. Git is a distributed version control system that can be opperated through a terminal. A version control system keeps records of changes that you make in a file over time, "_commits_". This allows you to be able to go through any commits made to a repository so that you can recall specific edits later if needed. Git allows you to pull your repository from online to your os and so much more when developing a website.

Since git allows us to save all files to a computer before uploading newly eddited text to a site, you are able to make changes before hand on any erros or new ideas. This also allows you to work on projects while not having to be connected to the internet or a specific network. Although we are going to be working through a terminal, git is fairly easy to get the hang of!

## First Steps


First things first, we need to make sure Git is downlaoded on your computer. If you so happen to have Git on your computer, make sure it is up to date with the latest verson avaliable!

#### >[Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win)

#### >[Linux](http://git-scm.com/download/linux)

### Claiming your work

Now that we haves Git installed, we need to enter in your user information to mark all the changes you make especially when making commits. 

Type the following into Terminal or Command Line:

```

git config --global user.name "Your name"

git config --global user.email "example@email.com"

```

To confirm that you have the correct settings, enter the following command:

```

git config --global user.name (should return Your name)

git config --global user.email (should return example@email.com)

```

*After completing this, it would be best to connect what ever text edditor that you are using so it can be opened from the terminal. Depnding on the os and text edditor, you can find out what git command to use online to tie it in!
